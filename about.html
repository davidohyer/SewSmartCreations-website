          <p class="section-lead reveal">Hi! I'm Deanna, and I've been passionate about sewing since I was a child. My grandmother taught me to sew when I was just seven years old, and those precious moments spent creating together sparked a lifelong love for this beautiful craft.</p>
          <p class="reveal">After years of seeing the joy of creating, I realized how much people thrive when they can create something tangible with their own hands. The pride on a person's face when they complete their first sewing project is absolutely magical.</p>
          <p class="reveal">I started Sew Smart Creations to bring that same joy and sense of accomplishment directly to families' homes. There's something special about learning in a comfortable, familiar environment where you can truly relax and focus on the creative process.</p>
